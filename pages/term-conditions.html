              <p>
                Through the Site, Agoda provides an online platform through
                which you can browse different types of lodging and temporary
                accommodation, including but not necessarily limited to hotels,
                hostels, serviced apartments, B&Bs, rooms for rent, cottages,
                ryokans, etc. (collectively, the “Accommodation(s)”) and request
                to make reservations with such Accommodations, including already
                making payment for such reservations of Accommodations in
                advance with a credit card, debit card, e-wallet, or such other
                payment method to facilitate the processing of such payment
                (“Payment Instrument”). By making a booking through the Site for
                the Accommodation, you make an offer to book a reservation at
                the price listed for such reservation and such other terms and
                conditions stated on the Site. This shall become a binding
                contract formed in Singapore pursuant to the Terms of Use when
                accepted by the Accommodation and consequently Agoda. You will
                receive proof of the confirmed Accommodation booking via an
                e-mail confirmation (with a voucher for prepaid Accommodations),
                which means the reservation has been confirmed by the
                Accommodation. The “thank you page” means your reservation
                request has been received and is complete for final processing,
                no further action is required by you. We reserve the right to
                reject bookings as set out below.
              </p>
              <p>
                When rendering our services, the information that we disclose
                about Accommodation is based on the information provided to us
                by our suppliers or providers (including but not necessarily
                limited to the Accommodation, their representatives,
                distributors, destination management companies (DMCs), channel
                managers, partners, etc.). As such, the Accommodations or their
                representatives are given access to an extranet or other
                connectivity solution through which they are fully responsible
                for updating all rates, availability, description, pictures,
                booking conditions, accommodation policies, and other
                information which is displayed on the Site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although we will use commercially reasonable skill and care in
                performing our services we will not verify if, and cannot
                guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete, correct,
                or up to date, nor can we be held responsible for any errors
                (including manifest and typographical errors), interruptions
                (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown,
                repair, upgrade or maintenance of the Site or otherwise),
                inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of
                information. Each Accommodation remains responsible at all times
                for the accuracy, completeness, and correctness of the
                Accommodation information displayed on the Site. Changes in
                market conditions or circumstances may occur on short notice
                which may make information displayed on the Site inaccurate or
                outdated. In case of problems, our Customer Service will use its
                commercially reasonable efforts to assist you and serve as a
                point of contact with the Accommodation.
              </p>

                Please note that Agoda is one of many channels Accommodations
                use to make their inventory available for reservation. When a
                search result indicates that a particular Accommodation has no
                more rooms available, that means the room type is not available
                for reservation through Agoda.
